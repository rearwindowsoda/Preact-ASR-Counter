# ASR Counter Fork

This is a fork of an Express.js + Handlebars app that I wrote some time ago. This fork is about separating front-end from backend and adding typescript for both.

> You can check the original app (Polish language only) [here](https://github.com/readwindowsoda/asr-public-git).

## TODO:

- [ ] Finish all the components,
- [ ] Optimize imports (aliases),
- [ ] Finish routing,
- [ ] Preparing env variables and base urls for data fetching.


### Stretch

- [ ]  Share types with backend :star_struck:,
