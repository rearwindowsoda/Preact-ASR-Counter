# ASR Counter Fork

This is a fork of a Express.js + Handlebars app that I wrote some time ago. This fork is about separating front-end from backend and adding typescript to both.

> You can check the original app (Polish language only) [here](https://github.com/readwindowsoda/asr-public-git).

## TODO:

[ ] - Finish routing,
[ ] - Optimize imports (aliases),
[ ] - Finish all the components,
[ ] - Preparing env variables and base urls for data fetching.


### Stretch

[ ] - Share types with backend :star_struck:,
